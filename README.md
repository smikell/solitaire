# Solitaire for the Bored Programmer
by Sam Mikell | [19 December 2019, Present]

My first project beyond the scope of school projects with specifications and guidance.

Solitaire is a game I first discovered on an iPod Nano when I was nine years old, and the game has stuck with me for years since.
As such, this project is focused on implementing Solitaire to be playable at the command line of Terminal or other Unix command line interfaces. Below describes how to play my version and other details about this project.

## Quick start

```console
$ make solitaire.exe
$ ./solitaire.exe
```

Be wary of longer run times due to time it takes to type each command and it starts to get tedious after a while

A typical solitaire game with point and click style might take around 5 minutes, but these games typically run around 15 minutes

Please give me recommendations on changes

One day I may implement a secondary version with Jokers and may try to implement a point and click version or some way to speed up the play. maybe a downloadable version for your desktop with minimal UI like terminal but some user-friendly features, but I do not have those skills at this moment.

## The Game (Add desc/instructions + info + goals for future)

Another name for this game is Patience, and this implementation of the game certainly requires it.
