# Solitaire for the Bored Programmer
by Sam Mikell | [19 December 2019, Present]
My first project beyond the scope of school projects with specifications and guidance

Be wary of longer run times due to time it takes to type each command and it starts to get tedious after a while

A typical solitaire game with point and click style might take around 5 minutes, but these games typically run around 15 minutes

One day I may implement a secondary version with Jokers and may try to implement a point and click version or some way to speed up the play. maybe a downloadable version for your desktop with minimal UI like terminal but some user-friendly features, but I do not have those skills at this moment.

## The Game (Add desc/instructions + info + goals for future)

Another name for this game is Patience, and this implementation of the game certainly requires it.

## Quick start
```console
$ make solitaire.exe
$ ./solitaire.exe
```
